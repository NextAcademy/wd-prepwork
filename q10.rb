# Write a "while" loop statement for the following scenario:

# 1) Prompt the user for the current room temperature in degree Celcius and then store it in a variable called "room_temperature"

# 2) Create a "while" loop to continuously prompt user for the current room temperature. 
# - If the temperature is above 20 degree celsius print "Air Conditioner is on" and keep on looping and continuously prompt user for the current room temperature.
# -Else print "Air Conditioner is off" and terminate the "while" loop
